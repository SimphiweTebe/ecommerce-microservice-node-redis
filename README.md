# Ecommerce microservice with Express and Redis

Using Node + Redis to build e-commerce microservices using the Pub/Sub pattern. 
This is obviously for practice purposes and not production-ready.

## Running the project

- Install all dependencies by running `yarn`in order-service and payment service folders
- Run `yarn start` on each directory to start running services parallel
- Use postman to make post requests

## What did I learn and discover?

- Will document soon
