# Learning Node + Redis Microservice basics

I now understand the advantages of using Node + Redis to cache requests. Thought I moved to a more slightly advanced topic - creating microservices using the Pub/Sub pattern. This is obviously for practice purposes and not in any way production-ready.

## Running the project

- Install all dependencies by running `yarn`

## What did I learn and discover?

- Will document soon
